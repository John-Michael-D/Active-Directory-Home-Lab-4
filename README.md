**Project #4(A-Q) - Setting Up Network Sharing on Windows Server**
- This project involved sharing folders, drive mapping, Share permissions, NTFS permissions, and File Resource Server Manager (FSRM) quota and screening configuration.
- A GPO was created to automate sharing a folder over the enterprise network and mapping it to a drive. This process makes it so users can access shared folders and documents upon signing in.
- The shared folder was then configured with the appropriate Share permissions (folder level) and NTFS permissions (file and sub-folder level). 
- FSRM was installed onto the Windows Server VM. 
- FSRM was configured to implement a file storage quota and file screening capabilities for the shared folder. 
- The file storage quota set a maximum storage amount and threshold alerts for the shared folder.
- The file screening options made it so that enterprise computer users could only store text files in the shared folder and not other files such multimedia files.
